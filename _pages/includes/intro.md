I am currently working on deep learning–based fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling, focusing on combining data-driven methods with traditional numerical simulation for flow–structure coupling problems. If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at [zhuxiangxiang@sjtu.edu.cn](mailto:zhuxiangxiang@sjtu.edu.cn).

I received my B.Eng. degree from the [College of civil engineering](https://tumu.njfu.edu.cn/), Nanjing Forestry University (南京林业大学土木工程学院) and my M.Eng. degree from the [School of Qilu Transportation](https://www.qltrans.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University (山东大学齐鲁交通学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Shaoshuai Shi (石少帅)](https://sft.sdu.edu.cn/info/1013/1058.htm). I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree at the [School of Ocean and Civil Engineering](https://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (上海交通大学船舶海洋与建筑工程学院), under the supervision of [Prof. Yong Cao (曹勇)](https://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/teachers/caoyong.html) and [Prof. Shenqi Zhang (章盛祺)](https://person.eitech.edu.cn/gxb/zsq/main.htm). 

Recently, one of my research projects has been carried out under the guidance of [Prof. Shiyi Chen (陈十一)](https://person.eitech.edu.cn/gxb/csy1/main.htm), an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year).
